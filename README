This will eventually be libpgf, a library for parsing and unparsing
texts using PGF grammars, which are produced by the Grammatical
Framework <http://www.grammaticalframework.org/>.

For now, the only thing provided is a pgf2yaml tool which converts
binary PGF files into the YAML format <http://yaml.org/> after which
they can be further processed with existing YAML software.

To build the library, you need a recent version (>= 2.24) of GLib
<http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/glib/>. Actual building
happens with the standard './configure && make' invocation.

To try out the tool, run './pgf2yaml < .../foo.pgf > .../foo.yaml'.

Libpgf attempts to track the changes to the PGF file format in the
development version of GF. It will not work with the PGF files
produced by older versions of GF.
